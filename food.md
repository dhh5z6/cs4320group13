#Food Information

My first thought as to where to shop was Aldi.
However, upon looking into their website they do not have prices listed online and they did not have several food items/supplies we would need for this trip. So, instead I went with the Wal-Mart option due to the fact that they offer price matching.
After totaling the draft of the foods list it came out to be $313.28 before taxes.
Below is a list of items we compiled for our grocerry list.
